# BME307_ContactLensDiffusion

This repository contains a mathematical model to simulate steady-state oxygen tension (P) distribution in the cornea and contact lens by incorporating Fickian diffusion and Michaelis-Menten reactions. The primary output of this model is the P distribution across the cornea and lens. Results generated by this model were used to determine parameters affecting P distribution in the eye, as well as the overall effect of contact lenses on hypoxia risk. 

The P distribution is represented across the cornea, which is represented as three layers (endothelium, stroma, and epithelium) and the contact lens, all with unique parameters. Specifically, each layer has a specified:
* Dk: oxygen permeability
* Q: Michaelis-Menten modeled oxygen consumption rate
* L: thickness
* D: diffusion coefficient

The key functions are listed below:
### O2(thickness, Dk_lens, Pair)
Solves for oxygen tension distribution across all 3 cornea layers and the lens using:
* Nonlinear finite-difference method
* SciPy root solver

Inputs:
* thickness: contact lens thickness (cm)
* Dk_lens: lens oxygen permeability ((cm^2 mL O2 / s mL mmHg)
* Pair: oxygen tension in the atmosphere (mmHg), which is only affected by altitude changes

Outputs:
* x: spatial grid (x[0] = anterior chamber, x[-1] surface of the lens) (cm)
* P: oxygen tension at each corresponding gridpoint (mmHg)
